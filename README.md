CSS-Portfolio Challenge Submission

I have used advanced CSS and HTML to create a basic Portfolio page to showcase my projects created during the bootcamp. I used CSS flexbox to create a dynamic web page that will show case my portfolio on various screen sizes.

*When navigation links are clicked UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
*Created link to the section about their work is clicked it leads to a section with titled images of the recent projects.
*First Project showcased larger in size than the others.
*Deployed application can be accesed by clicking the images.Have used samples as I have only completed 1 project. 
*Used Media Query to get a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
