# CSS-Portfolio
This is a Advanced CSS: Portfolio challenge for which I used CSS and HTML to create a basic web page to showcase my projects created during the bootcamp. I used CSS flexbox to create a dynamic web page that will show case my portfolio on various screen sizes.

Portfolio Highlights:

*The webpage showcase portfolio where the potential employer can view the the webpage and it displays the 
the developer's name, a recent photo and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
*When navigation links are clicked UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
*Created link to the section about their work is clicked it leads to a section with titled images of the recent projects.
*First Project showcased larger in size than the others.
*Deployed application can be accesed by clicking the images.Have used samples as I have only completed 1 project. 
*Used Media Query to get a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
